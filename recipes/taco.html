    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This recipe makes just the taco meat. You have to buy everything else, of
      course. Make a big batch and use for a multiple of different meals: add to
      bean burritos for a more hearty and tasty burrito, or add a can of beans
      (kidney, red, or pinto) and use for Frito® Pie, Navajo tacos, or taco
      salad.
